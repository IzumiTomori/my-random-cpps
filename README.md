# my-random-cpps
Hi, I'm currently learning about competitive programmming stuffs, so... I somehow want to randomly share my cpp source codes.

So the image above is my codeforces (CF) account. yeah... I'm still a newbie with less than thousand rating. 
So be nice to me. Just kidding you can bully me if you want to, haha.
